conditional logic tips:
-always use && and || instead of & and |
-condition MUST be length 1, so cannot use vectorized functions/operations

helpful functions:
-all()/any(): collapse logical vectors into single value
-identical()/near(): compare values instead of ==
-switch(): can sometimes be used instead of a series of if / else if / else
-cut(): to bin continuous values
-stopifnot(): easy way to check conditions in functions


QUESTIONS:
-weird camelCase instances
-return()?
-how the hell does the ... work
-more about switch()
-comments should be "why" but current HW stuff seems pretty self-explanatory
